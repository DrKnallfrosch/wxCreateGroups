GroupCalculator documentation
=============================

Project Status: Incomplete but with a Promising Approach

Despite our best efforts, we were unable to successfully complete the project as originally envisioned. However, we have made significant progress and identified a viable approach that lays the groundwork for future development. Below is a summary of the challenges faced, the approach taken, and the potential next steps.

Challenges Faced
Technical Limitations: Certain technical constraints, such as compatibility issues with third-party libraries or unexpected behavior in the code, hindered the project's completion.

Time Constraints: The project timeline was tighter than anticipated, leaving insufficient time to address all edge cases and fully implement all features.

Complexity: The problem domain proved to be more complex than initially estimated, requiring additional research and experimentation.

Approach Taken
To address these challenges, we adopted the following approach:

Modular Development: We broke the project into smaller, manageable modules, allowing us to focus on individual components and ensure their functionality.

Iterative Testing: We implemented iterative testing to identify and resolve issues early in the development process.

Documentation: We prioritized thorough documentation, including code comments, docstrings, and a detailed README file, to ensure clarity and maintainability.

Progress Made
Core Functionality: The core functionality of the project was implemented and tested, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach.

Documentation: Comprehensive documentation was created, making it easier for future developers to understand and build upon the work.

Lessons Learned: Valuable insights were gained, which will inform future projects and help avoid similar pitfalls.

Next Steps
While the project remains incomplete, the approach taken provides a solid foundation for future work. Potential next steps include:

Refactoring: Refactor the code to improve performance and address any remaining technical limitations.

Feature Expansion: Implement additional features to enhance the project's functionality.

Collaboration: Seek collaboration with other developers or teams to bring fresh perspectives and expertise to the project.
